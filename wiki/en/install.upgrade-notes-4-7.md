# Upgrade notes: 4.7

What 4.7.0 changed. Nothing to change in a game: it builds, plays and saves as on 4.6.0. Every addition is optional;
all but the end's `keepPlaying` are presentation only, unseen by rules, saves and the solver.

The upgrade itself is [Upgrade](install.upgrade.md).

## From 4.6.0 to 4.7.0

Install `@quest-n-click/engine@4.7.0` ([Install from npm](install.from-npm.md)). What a game may use, each optional:

- **A character turns back** once the hero is done with it: `turnBack: true` on the room's actor
  ([Rooms](create.rooms.md#actors)).
- **The title screen's logo and buttons placed by the game**: `titleScreen` takes `logoWidth`, `logoCenter`, `logoTop`
  and `buttonsTop`, in units of the 640 x 400 scene ([Title and credits](create.title-credits.md)). A logo padded with
  transparent space to place it can lose its padding.
- **Travel on foot on the map**: `vehicle: 'walk'` on a place walks the hero along the route with their `walk` frames
  ([World map](create.world-map.md)).
- **A map without pins, or with small dots**: `map.pins: 'hidden' | 'dots'`, for a map whose picture draws its places
  ([World map](create.world-map.md#bare-pins)). The default, `'faces'`, is as before.
- **A region's `frame` is drawn**, outlined on the parent's image once the region is open
  ([World map](create.world-map.md#regions)). Remove a frame painted into the parent's image.
- **Images per language**: `i18n.images` in `game.ts` names, for an image id, the image each language draws in its
  place ([Translations](create.translations.md#i18n-images)).
- **An end that rolls the credits, shows the title, and lets the world go on**: `{ end: true }` takes `credits`,
  `title` and `keepPlaying` ([Title and credits](create.title-credits.md#end-of-chapter)). With `keepPlaying`, the end
  is still reached and saved, but a load puts the player back in the world after it. A plain `{ end: true }` is
  unchanged.
- **The page's title and description per language**: `site.json` takes `i18n`, the `title`, `shortName` and
  `description` in the game's other languages ([Layout of a created project](create.project-layout.md#site-json)).

**For the TypeScript of a project**, additions only: `quest-n-click/player` exports the types `SiteText`, `SiteTexts`
and `EndShow`; `Presenter.end` takes an optional `EndShow`, and `GameState` an optional `keepPlaying`.

**Fixed**: a thing's name shown on hover stays inside the scene near its left or right edge, and the travel map shows
a child region only once a place in it, or below it, is unlocked (it offered an empty region from the start).

**Supported versions** change: only the latest minor gets fixes from 4.7.0, security fixes included; 4.6 gets none, so
upgrade. The windows promised before keep their dates ([Stability and support](start.stability.md#versions)).

**For the maintainers**, the release commands retry git's network steps and say the way on after a failure, and
`prepare` moves the versioned locks' engine peer on a new minor. **For contributors**, the `routes` mutation set is
gated, CI's `external-consumer` job asks for no runner when the plan spares it, and the coverage ratchet is strict on every
pull request (`npx tsx tools/coverage-ratchet.ts --write` raises the floors it names).
